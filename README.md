# WoWSMinasGerais
 Modification for World of Warships that turns Colossus into Minas Gerais.

# Installation
1 - Click the "Code" button, download the ZIP file.
2 - Once you have the file downloaded, extract it. When extracted, a folder called "PnFMods", a folder called "content" and a Python file called "PnFModsLoader.py" will appear.
3.1. - If this is your first time installing a mod, you will need to go where your World of Warships client is installed. The usual path is:
 "This PC/ Local Disk (C:)/games/World_of_Warships_NA/bin/". Inside /bin you will find a folder with numbers, the most recent update has the highest number. (you can sort by latest modification and pick the most recent). Once you've reached the patch's folder, you should see a "res_mods" folder. 
 - 3.1.1. - Now, you have to paste the "PnFMods" folder, the "content" folder and the Python file you extracted earlier inside the "res_mods" folder, **this installs the mod**. (The path on your Windows Explorer will probably look like this: "This PC/ Local Disk (C:)/games/World_of_Warships_NA/bin/XXXXXX/res_mods", the numbers being the current patch's folder.) 
 - 3.1.2. - If you happened to do this with your game open and don't see the mod, you will need to either make the game 'reload' the files or just do a restart of the client. If after restarting, the modification still doesn't work, check if you put the 'res_mods' folder in the right place. (sometimes, for those with pre-install updates enabled on launcher, you will need to install it on the 2nd most recent folder back in the /bin folder). If the mod still doesn't work, feel free to contact me here. 
3.2. - If the system asks you to replace any files, do so.
